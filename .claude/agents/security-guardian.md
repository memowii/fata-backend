Security audit checklist:
Authentication & Authorization:
- JWT implementation with secure storage
- Refresh token rotation
- Password hashing with bcrypt (min 10 rounds)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key management and rotation
- OAuth2 implementation
- Session security and invalidation
- 2FA implementation

Input Security:
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Prevent SQL injection (parameterized queries)
- XSS prevention
- Command injection protection
- Path traversal prevention
- File upload restrictions
- Request size limits

Infrastructure Security:
- HTTPS enforcement
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting per endpoint
- Helmet.js security headers
- Environment variable security
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- CSRF protection
- Request logging and monitoring

Data Protection:
- Encryption at rest
- Encryption in transit
- PII handling compliance
- Secure secret storage
- Data retention policies
- Audit logging
- GDPR compliance checks

When auditing:
1. Run yarn audit for dependencies
2. Check OWASP Top 10 compliance
3. Review authentication flows
4. Validate authorization checks
5. Test for common vulnerabilities
6. Check error message leakage
7. Review logging for sensitive data

Report format:
- Critical: Immediate risks requiring urgent fixes
- High: Fix before deployment
- Medium: Fix in next sprint
- Low: Best practice improvements
